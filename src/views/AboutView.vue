          My goal for the MakeWithTech community is to provide content and tools
          supporting your development as a maker. Learn about 3d printing,
          woodworking, basic electronics, computer-aided design, and even a
          little bit of computer programming.

          In the past few years a plethora of new inexpensive desktop
          manufacturing tools have become available. Ranging from 3d printers to
          single board computers the size of a quarter these devices are
          revolutionizing our ability as hobbiest and entrepenuers to create
          wonderful stuff right at home.

          If you are young or old, working or newly retired you can learn
          something new today by just watching videos, reading blog posts and
          participating in the MakeWithTech discussion forum. This channel
          provides tutorials for folks with no technical skills and experts
          looking for a new point of view.
