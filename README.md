# 3d-printing-utilities -- Web Serial Javascript Vue Example

The 3d printing utilities are designed to assist users of
consumer grade 3d printer in the calibration of their
devices.

This is also an example of using the Web Serial API in
Javascript with the VUE framework and VUETIFY. 

The initial two utilities provided in this application
assist with calibrating FDM 3d printers that use G-Code. A
common problem faced by users of 3d printers is finding
appropriate software that supports interacting over a USB
connections with a 3d printer. The "GCODE USB TERMINAL"
provides users of 3d printers with an easy to access
solution since it runs from both Google Chrome and Microsoft
Edge.

These applications are designed for laptops, chromebooks and
desktop computers. While they may work on a tablet that has
USB capabilitiees I have not tested on tablets.
